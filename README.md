#### We have used SVM for classification techniques on various datasets. Some of the datasets are from [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

**Datasets considered are**
- Breast Cancer Detection
- Iris Dataset 

We also used **Hyper parameter tuning** using *GridSearchCV* from [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)to tune the model and have the best parameters for prediction.
